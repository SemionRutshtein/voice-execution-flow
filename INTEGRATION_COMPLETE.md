## 🚀 Current Status

### **All Services Running & Healthy:**

| Service | Status | URL | Purpose |
|---------|--------|-----|---------|
| 🏦 Banking App | ✅ Healthy | http://localhost:8000 | Main web application |
| 🤖 N8N | ✅ Healthy | http://localhost:5678 | AI workflow engine |
| 🗄️ MongoDB | ✅ Healthy | localhost:27017 | Database storage |

### **Integration Flow:**
1. **User** records voice → **Frontend**
2. **Frontend** sends audio → **Backend** (`/api/webhook/voice-message`)
3. **Backend** forwards to → **N8N** (`/webhook/voice-process`)
4. **N8N** processes with → **OpenAI** (Whisper + GPT-4)
5. **N8N** returns → **Backend** → **Frontend** → **User**

## 🔧 Next Step: Setup N8N Workflow

### **IMPORTANT**: You need to manually create the N8N workflow:

1. **Open N8N Interface**: http://localhost:5678
2. **Follow Instructions**: See `setup-n8n-workflow.md`
3. **Create the workflow with**:
   - Webhook (path: `voice-process`)
   - OpenAI Audio Transcription (Whisper)
   - OpenAI Chat Completion (GPT-4)
   - Response formatting

### **Your OpenAI API Key**:
```
YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```
**Note**: Replace with your actual OpenAI API key in the N8N workflow setup.

## 🎯 How to Use

### **Start Services:**
```bash
./docker-run.sh start
```

### **Create N8N Workflow:**
1. Go to http://localhost:5678
2. Follow `setup-n8n-workflow.md` instructions
3. Use the provided OpenAI API key

### **Test the App:**
1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Record a voice message like:
   - "What is my account balance?"
   - "How do I transfer money?"
   - "Set up automatic payments"
3. Get AI-powered banking assistance!

### **Manage Services:**
```bash
./docker-run.sh status    # Check service status
./docker-run.sh logs      # View app logs
./docker-run.sh stop      # Stop all services
```

## 📁 Key Files Updated
